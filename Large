This is our story…

ALI LAMU is a fisherman who one day when the sea was rough and impossible for fishing came to me asking for a job. I told him that unfortunately I din’t have a job but I asked him if he knew where I could buy some of the old dhow’s sail (in Swahili called TANGA) because I always loved the material, I always looked at it as a piece of art designed by the wind, the salt of the sea water, the sun, the rain, and years of travelling over the ocean.

Ali came back a few days later with a very old tanga, the color was just magnificent a brownish color impossible to reproduce even if one tried hard, the weather and years were master of that piece of art. We started to open it and look at it, in the middle of the tanga there was a big hole probably created by strength of the wind during years and years of navigation, I looked at it and said…this looks just like the hole I have in my heart at the moment, created by the strength and pain of love…

The day after Ali came back with a tin of red and black paint, and together we started to paint a big red heart around the hole, then I dipped my brush into the black paint and wrote: LOVE AGAIN FOREVER WHATEVER...

Well this is how it all started….with and because of a broken heart….there is always a reason….follow your star….
After the first broken heart we made many more paintings that with our huge surprise and joy went all around the world, our art is all based on the mood of the moment….it is simple, what you see is what we feel.

Love poem from a broken heart, inspired by DavidO.
